5a962a93b0a95c085cbe2d2c,EIB,Integration,"Use the Enterprise Interface Builder (EIB) to build simple inbound and outbound integrations between Workday and external endpoints. EIB gives you a framework to build your own integrations based on your unique business needs

Upload data into Workday by using:
- An attachment.
- A REST-based URL.
- A file transfer from an external SFTP, FTP/SSL, or FTP endpoint.

Workday represents the integration as an Enterprise Interface, which you build and configure before the integration is ready to launch. You can design an Enterprise Interface by using a wizard design method. Create simple inbound or outbound integrations in a few steps with the wizard, which guides your configuration with appropriate options based on the data flow.

EIB Components: 
An EIB has 3 components:

1) Get Data
This component can indicate:
The data Workday receives from an external source (Example: a spreadsheet of budget data) and the location of that data (Example: a specific URL or FTP site).
The data that the integration extracts from Workday (Example: a specific custom report)
2) Transform
This component converts the data into a format that Workday or the receiving external endpoint can understand. Workday provides some delivered transformations, but you can also create your own transformations.
3) Delivery
This component defines how Workday imports data from or exports data to an external endpoint. Examples: email, SFTP, and web services.",,"""Inbound: - EIB spreadsheets using secure FTP: 300 MB - Files uploaded from a browser: 30 MB."",""Outbound EIBs retrieving custom report or web service data: 30 hours. Any pause in processing doesn't count toward the 30-hour limit.
Inbound EIBs loading Workday Web Service or Custom Object data: 30 hours. Any pause in processing doesn't count toward the 30-hour limit.
Inbound EIBs creating the Failure Report, Errors & Warnings spreadsheet, and Add Errors to Attachment spreadsheet: 2 hours.

Workday hosts and maintains all integrations.

Workday provides 2 types of Connectors:

End-to-end Connectors support a specific named third-party application or service. When you deploy a Connector, the Connector supports the third-party application with no additional coding required.
Connectors are prebuilt integrations that address most of the integration effort required to connect to third-party end points. These integrations import and export data in a Workday-defined file format.
Note: All Connectors require some level of tenant configuration and testing. Each customer can have specific mapping requirements and different endpoint configurations. Workday integration templates and mapping capabilities can accommodate these differences in customer configurations.
Each integration template provides a framework for Workday to communicate with an external endpoint. Each integration template contains a set of integration services, comprised of integration attributes and maps, that define specific connection points. To reduce complexity, many integration templates have factory settings for common definitions and requirements.",,,"[""General Workday knowledge"",""XML"", ""XSLT""]"
